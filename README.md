# tui4s

A terminal runner for [kyo-ui](https://github.com/getkyo/kyo), in Scala 3.

<!-- claude 2026-10-12: changed these lines: tui4s runs kyo-ui values (C1) -->
A kyo-ui value describes the screen; tui4s lays it out in terminal cells and
paints it with [jatatui](https://github.com/oyvindberg/jatatui), a Java port of
[ratatui](https://ratatui.rs). The core runs on [Kyo](https://getkyo.io).
Integrations for [ZIO](https://zio.dev) and
[Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) are planned.

> **Status:** under construction. Nothing is published yet.
